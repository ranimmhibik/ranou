    <h1>love at war</h1>
    <p id="i">What if your only chance to say “I love you” was the night before a battle?<br>
        What if falling in love meant risking your life? <br>
        War changes everything — including how we love</p> 

        <p class="p">In times of peace, love often unfolds slowly, with hopes for the future. But when the world is at war, love becomes urgent, fragile, sometimes forbidden. It’s a final kiss on a train platform, a letter smuggled across borders, a memory that keeps someone alive through the noise of bombs.
        Wartime pushes love to its limits. It transforms relationships, forces difficult choices, and sometimes turns a simple emotion into a heroic act. Through literature, film, poetry, music, and art, we can see how love during war reflects both the violence of history and the strength of human emotion. 
        In this presentation, I want to explore how love is portrayed during wartime through three main perspectives:</p>
        <ol>
        <li> <a href="#1">First, how love becomes a form of resistance and emotional survival, a refuge from chaos.</a></li>
        <li> <a href="#2">Second, how war interrupts and separates lovers, turning love into absence, silence, and longing.</a></li>
        <li> <a href="#3">And third, how war creates space for forbidden or hidden love, born out of danger, difference, or secrecy.</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="1">I. Love as Resistance and Survival</h2>
<h3 class="p">How love gives strength and becomes a refuge during the horrors of war.</h3>
<p class="p">Documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book: Birdsong by Sebastian Faulks (official list) – explores a powerful love affair before and during WWI.</li>
<li>Poem: “Dulce et Decorum Est” by Wilfred Owen – contrast between the brutality of war and the purity of human emotion.</li>
<li>Song: “We’ll Meet Again” by Vera Lynn – emblematic of hope and emotional survival during WWII.</li>
</ul>
<div>the real work will be added soon</div>
<h2 id="2">II. Love Interrupted: Separation, Distance, and Loss</h2>
<h3 class="p">Focus on lovers torn apart by war, either emotionally or physically.</h3>
<p class="p">Documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book: Atonement by Ian McEwan – explores separation, misunderstanding, and the consequences of war on love.</li>
<li>Film: Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) – iconic WWII-era love story framed by political conflict and sacrifice.</li>
<li>Poem: “To His Love” by Ivor Gurney – mourning a lost companion, love tinged with death and memory.</li>
</ul>
<div>the real work will be added soon</div>
<h2 id="3">III. Forbidden and Hidden Love in War Contexts</h2>
<h3 class="p">How war creates contexts for unusual, secret, or taboo love stories.
War doesn’t always involve weapons—it can also be the clash of identities, races, or societal expectations. In this axis, we explore how love emerges or is silenced in deeply divided worlds.</h3>
<p class="p">Documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book: To Kill a Mockingbird – though not a war novel, it presents racial conflict as a battlefield. Mayella’s forbidden attempt at affection for a Black man results in tragedy. Meanwhile, the love between Atticus and his children shows how moral courage can be a quiet form of resistance.</li>
<li>Film: Life is Beautiful – love and fatherhood inside a concentration camp.</li>
<li>TV Series: The Halcyon – secret loves across class and gender during WWII.</li>
<li>Image: Times Square Kiss – public passion at the end of WWII, but also controversial today.</li>
</ul>
<div>the real work will be added soon</div>
